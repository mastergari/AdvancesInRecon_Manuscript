	abstract = {Brain glucose hypometabolism has been observed in Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) patients, and is detected with (18)F radiolabelled glucose, using positron emission tomography. A pathological hallmark of {AD} is deposition of brain β- amyloid plaques that may influence cerebral glucose metabolism. The five times familial {AD} (5XFAD) mouse is a model of brain amyloidosis exhibiting {AD}-like phenotypes. This study examines brain β-amyloid plaque deposition and (18){FDG} uptake, to search for an early biomarker distinguishing 5XFAD from wild-type mice. Thus, brain (18){FDG} uptake and plaque deposition was studied in these mice at age 2, 5 and 13 months. The 5XFAD mice demonstrated significantly reduced brain (18){FDG} uptake at 13 months relative to wild-type controls but not in younger mice, despite substantial β- amyloid plaque deposition. However, by comparing the ratio of uptake values for glucose in different regions in the same brain, 5XFAD mice could be distinguished from controls at age 2 months. This method of measuring altered glucose metabolism may represent an early biomarker for the progression of amyloid deposition in the brain. We conclude that brain (18){FDG} uptake can be a sensitive biomarker for early detection of abnormal metabolism in the 5XFAD mouse when alternative relative uptake values are utilized.},

	abstract = {The collimator in single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}), is an important part of the imaging chain. One of the most important collimators that used in research, preclinical study, small animal, and organ imaging is the pinhole collimator. Pinhole collimator can improve the tradeoff between sensitivity and resolution in comparison with conventional parallel-hole collimator and facilities diagnosis. However, a major problem with pinhole collimator is a small field of view ({FOV}). Multi-pinhole collimator has been investigated in order to increase the sensitivity and {FOV} with a preserved spatial resolution. The geometry of pinhole and multi-pinhole collimators is a critical factor in the image quality and plays a key role in {SPECT} imaging. The issue of the material and geometry for pinhole and multi-pinhole collimators have been a controversial and much disputed subject within the field of {SPECT} imaging. On the other hand, recent developments in collimator optimization have heightened the need for appropriate reconstruction algorithms for pinhole {SPECT} imaging. Therefore, iterative reconstruction algorithms were introduced to minimize the undesirable effect on image quality. Current researches have focused on geometry and configuration of pinhole and multi-pinhole collimation rather than reconstruction algorithm. The lofthole and multi-lofthole collimator are samples of novel designs. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review on recent researches in the pinhole and multi-pinhole collimators for {SPECT} imaging.},
